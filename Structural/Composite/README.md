#  Composite Pattern

Objects use other objects' fields and function through inheritance and composition.
Composition lets us make compound objects. 
* A simple mathematical expression comprised of simpler expressions.
* Grouping of shapes that makes several shapes.

Composite design pattern is used to treat both single and composite objects uniformly. (e.g with identical APIs)

**A mechanism for treating individual (scalar) and compositions of objects in a uniform manner.**

## Object Composition and Iteration

Expression : 2 + (3 + 4) as some form of tree


## Geometric Shapes

How to put several shapes together ?

## Neural Networks

## Notes

* Objects can use either objects either via inheritence or composition
* Some composed and singular objects need similar/identical behaviors.
* Composite design pattern lets us treat both types of objects uniformally.
* C++ has no special support for the idea of enumeration of objects. 
* Hack : A single object can 'masquerade' to become suitable for begin/end iteration.
