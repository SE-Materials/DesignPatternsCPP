#  Flyweight

Avoiding redundancy when storing data.

**A space optimization technique that lets us use less memory by storing externally the data associated with similiar objects.**

## MMORPG Scenario
- Plenty of users with identical first/last names.
- No sense in storing same first/last name over and over again.
- Store a list of names and pointers to them.

## Bold or Italic text in console
- Don't want each character to have an extra formatting character.
- Operate on ranges (e.g., line, start/end)

## Notes

* Store common data externally or use a Flyweight library type.
* Define the idea of 'ranges' on homogeneous collections and store data related to those ranges.
